I have few doubts regarding the topic.

    a. Is there a way to return all the properties of a class in a single method?
       I mean, I want to access all the properties of a class in a single getter function, is it possible, 
       because it seems, we can't use multiple return statement.
    
    b. Can I have less properties in Derived class than Super Class?
